Here is the BurgerBuilder project, which is done by me following the tutorials of Maximilian Schwarzmüller. You may find it here:

As you can see, the project is deployed with NOW and connected to FireBase, so all the orders you make could be found at the "Orders" page.

You may also check out the code structure in this repository. Happy Hacking :)
